# **Tartarus**
A Minecraft Terra generation pack that adds a ton of new biomes to the Nether!

Tartarus is a Terra world generation pack for Minecraft Java v1.19 that adds 12 custom biomes to the Nether! This includes vanilla biomes, however these biomes have been reworked to fit the scheme of this pack better. 

## Structure Generation
Nether Fortresses and Bastion Remnants just like vanilla.

## Ore Generation
Nether Gold, Quartz, and Ancient Debris that generate similar to vanilla nether ore generation.

## Credits
Tartarus was made possible only through the help and support from the PolyhedralDev team, as well as the default Overworld config packaged with Terra, which some edited configs can be found in various assets in Tartarus. You can check out the pack here: https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/TerraOverworldConfig

## Biome List
A list of screenshots and descriptions of all the biomes included in this pack can be found on the Wiki of this repository.

## Installing this pack
> Currently, you are only able to use this on Bukkit. While you technically *could* install this on other platforms, you have no option to generate this in the Nether. If you want to use this pack on Fabric, Forge, or other supported platforms, and you don't mind having Nether terrain in the Overworld, feel free to use this pack.

See how to install Tartarus [here](https://github.com/Jason-Ding19/Tartarus/wiki/Pack-Installation).
